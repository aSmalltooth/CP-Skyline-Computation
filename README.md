 We have developed a new personalized Skyline algorithm called CP-Skyline, basedon CP-Nets, which describes the Skyline service query in scenarios where users have conditional preferences.
 This method effectively prunes the search space and reduces computational costs by leveraging the semantics and reasoning capabilities of CP-Nets. The algorithm is designed to adapt well to various service distributions, as
 well as the number of parameters and preferences.

 The synthetic database is generated in file:Synthetic Generation

 We have given the code for screening candidate data and building a classification tree based on CP-net:filter data and Construction of Classification tree

 The folder NBAtest contains calculations of skyline under the NBA data set.
